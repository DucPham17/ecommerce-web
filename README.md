# Ecommerce-web (ROSE)
This is an ecommerce webapp, which can work like amazon, but smaller size and its name is rose. In this application the Admin is the only person can create, update, sell and delete producta.

## Motivation
I build this app so that myself or others people can become a seller and have their own website to sell what they want.
